# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Starting Our 3rd And Last Project In This Section, I Have Also Combined Two Parts Into One, Which I Originally Planned To Commit/Push Separatly, But It Was Too Short Surpisingly, So I Had To Combine Them😅, But It Just Means Less Parts For You To Learn And Worry About😉, The Two Parts Were, The Starter And Introduction, And Making The Functionality For The Dice Roll, And Like In The Code, I Am Proud Of You For Making This Far, A Point Where Very Few Make It To, You Failed Multiple Times, But Kept On Pushing Through, You Fell, And Rose Again, Now Reaching This Point, And Eventually Passing This And Many More Obstacles And Obstructions Ahead, So, Take A Break, Because You Earned It😄, Soon Enough, You Will Become A Master At Coding😎, While Your Motivation Must Have Been Lowered, Your Consistency Brought You Here🚀, And Will Take You To Taller And Massive Heights📈, So, Keep On Doing What You Brought You Here🫡, And Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur. And Once More...I Hope U Like It!
