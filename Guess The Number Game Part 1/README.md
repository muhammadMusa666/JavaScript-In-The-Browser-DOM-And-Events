# This Is The First Subrepo Of This Section, Aswell As The 1st Project That We've Ever Done, And To Clear Confusion Of DOM And DOM Manipulation, We Will Slowly Complete This Project In Different Parts, Thats Why This Is Part 1, And I Will Name The Topic That We Will be Implementing On The Project As Title While We Are Going Through The Project Slowly But Surely, I Hope This Doesnt Confuse You Or Make You Worry Into Thinking This Must Be Hard Because I Had To Divide It In Parts😅, But Thats Not All The Case! This Topic Is Simple, Just Very Long, Also, I Recommend You Also Learn HTML And CSS From Some Crash Course On Some Platform Like Youtube For Free, Because You Will Not Understand Most Of The Things About DOM And DOM Manipulation Without Knowing The Core Super Main Basics Of Both HTML And CSS, Not To Worry Though, There Are Plenty Of Free Crash Courses About It On Youtube, So Go Check Them Out😄, And Again, This Might Be Overwhelming, But If You've Made It Here? Than Going Past This Obstacle Will Be No Big Deal, As Long As You Try, And Even If You Fail, Make Mistakes, Then That Just Makes You Better, So Keep Coding, Let Me Know If You Encounter Any Errors. I Hope U Like It!
