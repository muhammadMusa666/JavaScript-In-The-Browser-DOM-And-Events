# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Implementing The Functioanlity For Holding The Current Score, This Was Incredibly Long, But No Worries, I Know You Can Do It If You've Made It This Far😄, This May Be Inconvenient For Some People, So I Am Sorry If You Are Experiencing It That Way😔, Either Way, I Will Once Again, Congratulate You For Making This Far👏, And Keep Practicing This Code, In The Next Subrepo, We Will Implement The Functionality For Resetting The Game, Also For Those Wanting To Make Project Like This, I Recommend Making Game Type Ones, Because They Are Way More Fun, And Will Bring You More Motivation To Build More, Eventually Creating A Habit Or Hobby😎, But Thats Your Choice, You Can Build Whatever You Want, According To Your Likings😉, Anyways, Let Me Know If You Encounter Any Errors. I Hope U Like It!
