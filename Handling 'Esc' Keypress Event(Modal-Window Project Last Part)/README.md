# In This Subrepo, We Will Be Handling Keypress Events, So The Keys On Your Keyboards, And Make Our Modal Window Go Away When We Press The Escape Key, This Was'nt That Long, But Also Not That Short, And It Might Be Confusing, But For The Most Of You Who've Got This Far, It Might Not Be😄, This Is Also The Third And Last Part Of This Project, Which Is Pretty Short, AnyWho, This Project, Well In My Opinion, Also Contained Alot Of Important Stuff To Know, And May Be One Of The Hardest To Understand For Beginners, But If Your Reading This, Then You've Obviously, Already Completed It With Me😉, So CONGRATS👏, But Anyways, There Is One Last Project Left In This Section, And Dont Worry, I Think It'll Be A Short One, I'll Try Atleast😅, Anyways, Let Me Know If Any Errors Occur. I Hope U Like It!
